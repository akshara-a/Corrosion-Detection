# Corrosion Detection Using Deep Learning and Ensemble Approaches

## Overview

This project explores the use of **Deep Learning** and **Ensemble Approaches** for **corrosion detection**. Corrosion is a significant issue affecting the infrastructure of buildings, pipes, and machinery, leading to high maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. The research presented in this study aims to improve corrosion detection accuracy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with advanced ensemble methods such as **Random Forest** and **Extra Trees**. 

The results show that CNNs are highly effective for feature extraction from corrosion images, and when paired with ensemble techniques, they can significantly improve detection accuracy and robustness. This approach has the potential for applications in early detection systems, such as **drone-based inspections** and **web applications** for infrastructure monitoring.
